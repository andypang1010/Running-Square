# Running-Square
My first complete Unity project based on another game I have seen. Completed all by myself with the occasional help to look up the implementation of certain UI or functionalities and reference to the Udemy Unity course by GameDev.tv.

This game is about a cube that is constantly accelerating across a game board to reach a destination. The difficulty of the game increases exponentially as the velocity of the cube increases. There will be obstacles on the way of different types: spinning, falling, and stationary. This is a fun game where you get to try your best to go to the finish line at 4,900m.
