# Running-Square
My first complete Unity project inspired by a similar game I have seen earlier in the year. Completed all by myself with the occasional help to look up the implementation of certain UI or functionalities and reference to the Udemy Unity course by GameDev.tv.

A 3D game involving a cube that is constantly accelerating across a game board to reach a destination. The difficulty of the game increases as the velocity of the cube increases, making it harder to control. There will be different types of obstacles on the way: spinning obstacles, arbitrarily falling obstacles, and stationary obstacles. This is a fun and minimalist game where you get to try your best to go to the finish line at 4,900m.
